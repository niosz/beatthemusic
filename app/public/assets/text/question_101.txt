Smooth like butter, 
like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking 
into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, 
I owe it all to my mother, uh
Hot like summer, yeah, 
I'm making you sweat like that (break it down!)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar **????** so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)

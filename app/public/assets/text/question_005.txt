The only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex lover but before you leave
Usually I would never, would never even care
Baby, I know she creepin' I feel it in the air
Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your
Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody
Break your heart?
Lookin' like **??????**
Savage love

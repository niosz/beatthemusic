And I see you (oh),
the way I breathe you in (in),
it's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you,
baby, never let you go, oh, ooh
And I say, oh, there's nothing like your **??????**
It's the way you lift me up, yeah
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end
I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (Badass bitch)
